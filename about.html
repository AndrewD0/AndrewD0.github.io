      <h1 id="about">Hey! My name is Andrew.</h1>
      <p>
        I am a 4th year <b>engineering physics</b> student studying at the University of British Columbia.
        <br><br>
        I am passionate and skilled in working with electrical circuits, machine learning, and hardware design. I'm currently taking courses in PCB design, pure physics, and large-language models.
        <br><br>
        Above is a visualization of my <b>Obsidian</b> database. Each node represents a specific topic that I have learned in-depth about.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website contains a working repository of all the projects Iâ€™ve worked on to date. I hope you find them interesting!
